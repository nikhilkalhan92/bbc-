# Instructions

You have been given some data by the editorial department in the `./src/data` directory.

They need you to build an interactive project where users will select an Indian city and have their local air quality displayed in cigarettes and particulate matter.

How the users select their city is up to you: editorial have used dropdowns, buttons, maps, and keyword entry autocomplete text fields before. It's your choice.

## Techincal requirements

The task must be served as all flat files so that the solution can scale in a serverless environment - e.g. HTML, CSS, and JS in S3

The task could use node, npm, webpack, babel etc to compile/transpile into the end project files for deployment. Whatever environment you are comfortable with, but no jquery, please.

The project is going to go live in areas that do not have good broadband access, so please pay attention to file size and performance.

Some users may have older phones, so please ensure your code works on IE11 and up.

## Project requirements

Must have: 
- Ability for users to choose a city and see air quality in the form of cigarettes and particulate matter (PM2.5)
- all text fields from the data json file displaying in a logical manner
- All production files outputted into a `./dist` folder ready for making live.

Nice to have:
- A version in hindi (data also supplied in separate JSON file)
- Test cases for your code.

## What we're looking for

Ideally, we're looking for a logical approach to the work, some creativity, beautiful code and a nice output, but we are not expecting a finished product by a long chalk.

Don't spend too long on it. Try and cap it at 4 hours.

This really is an opportunity for us to see how you think, how you organise yourself, how you express yourself. Have fun!
