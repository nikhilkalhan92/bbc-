## Air Pollution ##

Hi - welcome to my project based on air pollution in various cities across india.

My thought process was first I needed to do an autocomplete and chart to present the results. The whole project using HTTML5/CSS3 and JS. I also needed to design the home page to be easy to use and read.

## How to use ##

1) Type any given city from India, and the results of the air pollution levels will be shown via a donut graphic on the front screen.

- Please type any Indian city, and you'll see the results of the air pollution level. Please click submit.

2) Option to change language and read the information in Hindi . Please select change language on the front screen and click it again to go back to english.

Instructions
You have been given some data by the editorial department in the ./src/data directory.

They need you to build an interactive project where users will select an Indian city and have their local air quality displayed in cigarettes and particulate matter.

How the users select their city is up to you: editorial have used dropdowns, buttons, maps, and keyword entry autocomplete text fields before. It's your choice.

Techincal requirements
The task must be served as all flat files so that the solution can scale in a serverless environment - e.g. we would put the HTML, CSS, and JS into S3 and serve statically

The task could use node, npm, webpack, babel etc to compile/transpile into the end project files for deployment. Whatever environment you are comfortable with, but no jquery, please. If you prefer, you can build a webpage by hand - it's up to you.

The project is going to go live in areas that do not have good broadband access, so please pay attention to file size and performance.

Some users may have older phones, so please ensure your code works on IE11 and up.

Project requirements
Must have:

Ability for users to choose a city and see air quality in the form of cigarettes and particulate matter (PM2.5)
all text fields from the data json file displaying in a logical manner
All production files output into a ./dist folder ready for making live.
Nice to have:

A version in hindi (data also supplied in separate JSON file)
Test cases for your code.
What we're looking for
Ideally, we're looking for a logical approach to the work, some creativity, beautiful code and a nice output, but we are not expecting a finished product by a long chalk.

Don't spend too long on it. Try and cap it at 4 hours.

This really is an opportunity for us to see how you think, how you organise yourself, how you express yourself. Have fun!

Help
If you have any issues with this assessment or require some clarification then please email your contact at the BBC.

Submission
Please send your code together with a Readme file explaining how to install/run the project and any other notes as a Zip file or a GitHub repository. Please also confirm that we have received the test (it may get blocked by spam filters).
